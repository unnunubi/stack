RESUME
********************************************************************************
This is a simple RMT policy which start to mark packets with congestion flags
when a threshold is overcomed in the RMT buffers. In IRATI the RMT buffers 
begins to be used when the ipcp signal a problem in dispatching a pdu. This is 
caused usually by some block in the flows (rate credit consumed) or if the NIC
driver is not able to catch up the speed at which datagram are offered.

IMPORTANT DECLARATIONs
********************************************************************************

ECN_THRE
	This defined ow many pdu can be safely enqueued before marking them as
	congested during dequeuing operation. This limit is maintained low on 
	porpouse (5 pdus).
	
ECN_TIMED_LOG
	Uncomment this symbol to obtain a logging mechanism of the RMT queue 
	status without having the kernel log overruned of messages. This 
	mechanism will also report if, during the log procedures, some pdu were
	dropped (due the reaching of queue default limit).

PARAMETERS
********************************************************************************
q_thre
	This parametric policy changes the threshold of the ports that will be 
	created from this point on. It wont change threshold of previously
	created ports.
