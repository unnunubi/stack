Receiver congestion Detection, Sender Reaction policies.

RESUME
********************************************************************************
This set of policies will provide a congestion control set of policies which 
allows to take advantage of the rate based flow control to avoid congestions in 
your favourite topology.

Whenever congestion happens in an intermediate node, it will mark pdus which
pass through it, leaving other flows free to achieve the desired rate (if they
took different routes).

COMPONENTS
********************************************************************************
- ecn: Explicit Congestion Notification policy.
	a very basic congestion detection RMT policy which starts to mark
	packets as Congested when you start to use the RMT queues.
	
- cdrr: Congestion Detection Rate Reduction policy.
	A DTCP policy which adapts the flows to their average bandwidth when 
	congestion-marked pdus are detected. If no congestion is occurring then 
	it allow the flow to push at a predefined 
	rate that you can set.
		
- fare: Flow Allocation Rate Enforcement policy.
	A FA policy which reads set the flow rate to the average bandwidth 
	requested (which we threat as Minimum Granted Bandwidth).
	
All these policies works independently from each other. You can replace the RMT
or DTCP with your own without any problem, if you need to perform alternative
behaviors.

BUILD
********************************************************************************
For kernel mode components ECN and CDRR:
just invoke the makefile present in the same folder where the sources are. You
must be under IRATI-compiled kernel.

For user space mode component FARE:
you have to replace existing elements with the path where you installed the 
IRATI userspace components. See comments in the make file for additional info.
