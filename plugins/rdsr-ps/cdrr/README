Congestion Detection Rate Reduction policy for OpenIRATI.

********************************************************************************
RESUME
********************************************************************************
This is a DTCP level policy. It stores the value of the QoS avg. bandwidth as 
the preferred minimum rate at which the flow must be set in case of congestion.
Until a congestion occurs at receiver side, the policy allows the flow to speed
up at a given rate, which is called reset-rate (if you set it to the real 
link rate then you will be able to use all the offered resources).

********************************************************************************
NO ECN
********************************************************************************
The mechanism can be used without ECN flagged packets, using a simple congestion
guessing heuristic. You have to compile the policy with the pre-processor symbol
CDRR_NO_ECN in order to do it (see upper part of the code source).

Such heuristic just count the active flows and sum up the reset rate given; if 
the sum exceed a given link capacity value, then the server is marked as 
congested and all the flows are adjusted to their avg. bandwidth.

As default only 32 concurrent flows are handled; you can change this value 
setting the pre-processor macro CDRR_MAX_FLOWS before the compilation.

IMPORTANT DECLARATIONs
********************************************************************************
Just at the begin of the policy there are declared the important statement for
the code sheet, such as:

CDRR_DEFAULT_RESET_RATE
	Rate at which adapt if no congestion is detected. Should be set in 
	accord with CDRR_DEFAULT_TIME_FRAME.
	Value in bytes.

CDRR_DEFAULT_LINK_CAPACITY
	Link maximum capacity. Should be set in accord with 
	CDRR_DEFAULT_TIME_FRAME.
	Value in bytes.

CDRR_DEFAULT_TIME_FRAME
	Time frame for computation of the rate based flow control.
	Value in ms.
	
CDRR_DEFAULT_RESET_TIME
	Reset time for the NO ECN mechanism. This is the amount of time which
	should pass before considering the flow as no more emitting. 
	Value in ms.
	
********************************************************************************
PARAMETERS
********************************************************************************
mgb
	Parametric policy which allows to change the Minimum Granted Bandwidth
	for this flow at runtime.
	
reset_rate
	Parametric policy which allows to change the rate at which the flow is
	set if no congestion is detected along its route.
